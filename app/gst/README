This program works on Freescale iMX6 board with fsl gstreamer plugins,
because it needs VPU decoder/encoder.
main.c version with left aligne toolbox and all four video windows grouped at right side.
main_center.c version where OSD divided on four equal windows and each video centred in it's own window.

before building please set appropriate streams in quad.sh
and be sure that board accessible by ssh and set ip address in Makefile.rules

then just
# make all
